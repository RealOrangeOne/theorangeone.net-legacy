Student Robotics is the the place where my development knowledge really started to grow. Thanks to the other people in my team teaching me. I had never done anything robotics related, and so when my computing teacher initially told us about it, I wasn't really interested. After I found out that my friend was also doing it, I signed up, and went along to the kickstart. From then on I was hooked, getting involved with all aspects of the development and design, as well as helping out other teams on the IRC room.

## What is Student Robotics?
> Student Robotics is a volunteer organisation that runs an annual robotics competition for 16-18 year olds. It was originally founded by students from the University of Southampton in 2006, and now includes volunteers (“Blue Shirts”) from multiple other universities, including the University of Bristol and Grenoble INP. It primarily takes teams and volunteers from the UK, but also some from Germany and France.

More information can be found on [their website](https://studentrobotics.org).

## My Entries
Being at college for 2 years, meant I was able to enter 2 years of competitions, SR14, and SR15. We were encouraged to gain an online presence for our team, so I created a website for both years. Unfortunately due to account inactivity, and me changing my website 3 times since, The original pages have been lost, however a large amount of the content the content still remains.

## Adult volunteer
Unfortunately, after I left college, I also left behind entering Student Robotics as a competitor. Fortunately for me however, they're always looking for volunteers to help run the competition itself.
