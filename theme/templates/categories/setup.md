My setup is much more of a project than something that is stable and constant. I am constantly upgrading, and changing things, whether it's on my main machine (which most of it is), my desk at work, or just a standard upgrade to my phone. As I use technology every day, for many, __Many__ hours, I need it to work brilliantly, and not hold me back from anything I want to do.

As well as my main desk, there are a few other machines I use often, namely my laptop, work rig, and my phone. All of which follow the same criteria of not holdng me back from what I wantever to do.
