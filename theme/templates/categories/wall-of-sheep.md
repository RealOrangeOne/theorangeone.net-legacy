I've always had a keen interest with security and privacy. Whether it's protecting my personal information, or needlessly encrypting things, security is very important to me. With an interest in keeping things secure, comes an interest in breaking others.

Whenever I start using a new tool, or piece of software, I almost instantly go to the security settings and check out what it supports. The same goes for making the software, I've been known to spend a lot of extra time working on the security aspect more than actual features.

The [_Wall of Sheep_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxq_Xx-5vQ) comes from a concept at [DEFCON](https://defcon.org/), where any insecure information sniffed over wireless is displayed on a wall to shame those who's data is up there.

This is my wall. A list of things I've broken the security of, or spotted with terrible security.
