    <p>I've been making Youtube videos now for the past couple of years, originally on my old channel that I worked on with my mate, and now on this one that's just me. The primary reason I make my videos is to help people out, and hopefully solve a problem for them, as I do exactly the same when I need help with a problem</p>
    <p>With this channel, I want to kep the content educational and to a very high quality, therfore making it easier for people to find exactly what they need to know from my videos. I've built up a lot of knowledge in the field of technology and computing, and I believe I have a responsibiluty to share this so that others can learn too!
