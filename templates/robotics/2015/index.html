        <h2>The Competition</h2>
        <p>As was announced at kickstart, the game for this year is a take on the classic gamemode Capture the Flag. 4 teams compete over 5 flags to move as many of them as they can into their scoring zones. The person with the most flags in their scoring zone wins.</p>
        <p>The 'flags' are 25cm cubes of wood on caster wheels weighing roughly 2kg. The rules prevent us from lifting them, so the idea is to drag them around!</p>
