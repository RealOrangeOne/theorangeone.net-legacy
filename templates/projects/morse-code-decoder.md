# Morse Code Decoder

It's not often someone will need to decode text into morse code (and visa-versa), but if I had something like this when I needed it, it would have saved me hours of time!

I originally wrote this code for the [Student Robotics 2015](/robotics/2015/) Entry, to convert a string message into a morse code message that would be transmitted using LEDs, for aesthetics and debugging. Unfortunately due to a fixed time frame, this idea was scraped before it could be fully implemented. Fortunately the decoder worked perfectly!


## Usage

In order to make it accessible for as many people in as many different languages as possible, the data is in JSON format. Just find a JSON library for your desired language, and it'll work perfectly!

The source of the library is on github as a gist. I recommend downloading the file to use yourself, however for testing you can use github's raw view as a hotlink.
