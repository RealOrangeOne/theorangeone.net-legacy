            Hi, I'm Jake, a software engineer currently working for a company in Brighton. I've been working as a developer since mid-2015, and have been studying IT and computer science since 2013.
            I work primarily as a full-stack developer, however more recently I've been working more on mobile apps.

      <h2>About my website</h2>
      <p>
        My website is the culmination of all my knowledge, compiled into 1 place. It not only contains all my projects, but it in itself is a project. Making sure this website works properly is a tall order, especially considering it's self hosted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site is primarily powered by <a href="http://getpelican.com">Pelican</a>, a static site generator. This converts markdown and HTML templates into static HTML files. The templates are generated using <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a>, a templating language similar to <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>'s. This allows me to write nice clean, <i>DRY</i> content, and have it come out as clean HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        The static content (JS, CSS etc) is built using a custom build pipeline. The Javascript is built and compiled using <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> and <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a>, and the CSS is written using <a href="https://github.com/sass/node-sass">node-SCSS</a> as a pre-processor.

      <h2>The Server</h2>
      <p>
        The website is hosted on my <a href="/setup/web-server/">UK VPS</a>. Previous versions have been hosted on <a href="https://www.1and1.com/">1&amp;1</a> and <a href="http://www.myWindowsHosting.com/index?r=100196823">MyWindowsHosting</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The static files are served using a <a href="https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/host-container">custom Express server</a>, which allows me to auto-deploy the site from my <a href="https://circleci.com/">CI</a>. This is then served using a custom, closed-source reverse proxy, which makes local development and domain switching much easier. This is pointed to by <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a>, which actually serves port 80.
