My setup is everything, I use my computer at least once a day to browse the internet, work on projects, even update this website, so it's very important that everything works perfectly and the fastest it can. Obviously this machine is probably a little too powerful for someone that does almost primarily software development, but it means when I want to do things like video editing, 3D modelling, or anything else that would require a high end computer, I can, because my computer is equipped to handle it.

Over the years, my setup has evolved from a single monitor i5 machine, to a triple monitor AMD FX-based monster of a computer.

[Current Parts list]()

This generation of my build was in response to an updated workflow. I'd recently started working on 3D modelling, and found the wonderful world that is PC gaming, and needed something slightly more powerful. It hasn't changed much since I originally built it, besides storage. The CPU cooler was changed from a 120mm AiO to an air cooler to stop things overheating, and the case was changed so I could fit more stuff in, like a few more drives.


### Next Generation

I've been using the current generation for around 3 years now, and it's worked perfectly for all of this. The main reason I'm upgrading is to get more features, The 990FX chipset is very old, and my motherboard is missing a few key features, such as dynamic fan control.

The next generation of my build isn't actually a thing yet, but I'm actively working on what it's going to look like and the components inside it. Currently it's going to be an Intel based build, unless AMD release the reported 16-core monster, which I obviously have to have! You can find the current parts list at the link below, the list is always changing.

[Next-Gen Parts List]()

Recently, I've been using linux more and more, and have switched this machine to Arch Linux. But some days I miss my windows-only applications and games, so I'm going to be using a virtual machine running windows, with a graphics card hardware pass-through to it, so I can run windows applications, and play windows-only games. The best of both worlds! I got the idea for doing this from a video [TekSyndicate](https://www.youtube.com/user/razethew0rld) made, which is by far the single greatest example of tech wizardry I've ever seen. You can find the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16dbAUrtMX4).


## Previous Generations

The first generation of this was the first custom build I'd ever done. When I first built this, I wasn't really into gaming, programming, or any kind of heavy workflow for that matter, so this build isn't particularly powerful, although compared to my old [Dell Inspiron 1525](http://www.pcworld.com/product/31104/dell-inspiron-1525.html), it was pretty damn incredible!

You can find the full list of parts over on the PCPartPicker link below. Unfortunately due to the lack of catalog, or bad memory on my part, not all the parts are there, but there are as many as possible.
