The server itself is a VPS hosted by [Inception hosting](https://clients.inceptionhosting.com/aff.php?aff=256). Obviously if I did more looking around I could probably find a slightly better deal, but these people have brilliant customer support, fast and customizable servers, that are also hosted in a data center in the UK (a major bonus)!

The spec on this server are nothing special, but considering it wouldn't be running much, other than a web server, and a couple of other applications, it's pleanty. The most important thing is that it is hosted in the UK, for connection speed, and for other applications like a VPN.
