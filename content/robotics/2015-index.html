      <h2>The Competition</h2>
      <p>
        As was announced at kickstart, the game for this year is a take on the classic gamemode Capture the Flag. 4 teams compete over 5 flags to move as many of them as they can into their scoring zones. The person with the most flags in their scoring zone wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'flags' are 25cm cubes of wood on caster wheels weighing roughly 2kg. The rules prevent us from lifting them, so the idea is to drag them around!
