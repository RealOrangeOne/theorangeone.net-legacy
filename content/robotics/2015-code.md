The code used for this competition was by far the most complicated and advanced code that had ever been written by a Collyer's team.

The main change between any other year was using an entirely co-ordinate based movement system. Any input taken in from the camera was converted to co-ordinates in terms of the arena, so we could plot our movement more accurately and allow for any immovable objects such as the internal walls.

The addition of this coordinate system allowed us to create the killer feature of this year, the position correction code. This code allowed us to automatically correct our position after we scanned for a marker, meaning we could allow for any imperfections in the build.

There were a lot of really great features in this years code, that made our robot function much faster:

- Position correction
- co-ordinate based movement
- Arc movement
- Distance based movement
- _move 'til touch_
- Camera rotation

### So, where is this code?
Unfortunately, due to the number of features, we have decided to keep the source private, so that only other Collyer's teams may access it. A lot of blood, sweat and tears (not literally) went into writing this code, and it would be a shame if that were to be used to help any of our opponents.

You can however see the code from some of our other years on our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/SR-CLY).
